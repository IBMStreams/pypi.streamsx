streamsx 1.15.1
===============

For changes in this release see the `CHANGELOG of the project. <https://github.com/IBMStreams/pypi.streamsx/blob/v1_15/streamsx/.toolkit/com.ibm.streamsx.topology/CHANGELOG.md>`_

Python Topology API for Streams
===============================
Module that allows the definition and execution of streaming
applications implemented in Python. Applications use Python code to process
tuples and tuples are Python objects.

See `streamsx.topology <https://streamsxtopology.readthedocs.io/en/v1.15.1/streamsx.topology.html#module-streamsx.topology>`_

Additional streamsx packages providing adapters and/or analytics
are `available at pypi.org <https://pypi.org/search/?q=streamsx>`_

Python callables as SPL operators
=================================
A Python function or class can be simply turned into an SPL primitive operator
to allow tuple processing using Python in an SPL application.

SPL (Streams Processing Language) is a domain specific language for streaming
analytics supported by IBM Streams.

See `streamsx.spl <https://streamsxtopology.readthedocs.io/en/v1.15.1/streamsx.spl.spl.html#module-streamsx.spl.spl>`_

Streams Python REST API
=======================

Module that allows interaction with an running Streams instance or service
through HTTPS REST APIs.

See `streamsx.rest <https://streamsxtopology.readthedocs.io/en/v1.15.1/streamsx.rest.html#module-streamsx.rest>`_
