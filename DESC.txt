Python APIs for use with Streaming Analytics service on
IBM Cloud and on-premises IBM Streams.

 * `Streaming Analytics service <https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/streaming-analytics>`_
 * `IBM Streams developer community <https://developer.ibm.com/streamsdev/>`_

See `1.12 release notes <https://github.com/IBMStreams/streamsx.topology/releases/tag/v1.12.4_beta>`_ for details on new functionality in this release.

Python Topology API for Streams
===============================
Module that allows the definition and execution of streaming
applications implemented in Python. Applications use Python code to process
tuples and tuples are Python objects.

See `streamsx.topology <https://streamsxtopology.readthedocs.io/en/latest/streamsx.topology.html#module-streamsx.topology>`_

Python callables as SPL operators
=================================
A Python function or class can be simply turned into an SPL primitive operator
to allow tuple processing using Python in an SPL application.

SPL (Streams Processing Language) is a domain specific language for streaming
analytics supported by IBM Streams.

See `streamsx.spl <https://streamsxtopology.readthedocs.io/en/latest/streamsx.spl.spl.html#module-streamsx.spl.spl>`_

Streams Python REST API
=======================

Module that allows interaction with an running Streams instance or service
through HTTPS REST APIs.

See `streamsx.rest <https://streamsxtopology.readthedocs.io/en/latest/streamsx.rest.html#module-streamsx.rest>`_
