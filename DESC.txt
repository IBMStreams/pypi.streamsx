streamsx 1.14.4 beta
====================

Alpha release, functionality and API subject to change before GA release.

Please evaluate these items in 1.14 beta:

 * `Composite transformations for topologies <https://streamsxtopology.readthedocs.io/en/v1.14.4_beta/streamsx.topology.composite.html>`_
    
 * Python type hints are used to define stream schemas and verify topologies at declaration time.
     * `Setting stream schema from type hints <https://streamsxtopology.readthedocs.io/en/v1.14.4_beta/streamsx.topology.topology.html#stream>`_
     * `Type checking at topology declaration time <https://streamsxtopology.readthedocs.io/en/v1.14.4_beta/streamsx.topology.topology.html#callables>`_
 * Higher level `build <https://streamsxtopology.readthedocs.io/en/v1.14.4_beta/streamsx.topology.context.html#streamsx.topology.context.build>`_ and `run <https://streamsxtopology.readthedocs.io/en/v1.14.4_beta/streamsx.topology.context.html#streamsx.topology.context.run>`_ functions.
 * Python 2.7 support has been dropped.
 * Functionality marked deprecated in 1.13 or earlier releases has been removed.

Python Topology API for Streams
===============================
Module that allows the definition and execution of streaming
applications implemented in Python. Applications use Python code to process
tuples and tuples are Python objects.

See `streamsx.topology <https://streamsxtopology.readthedocs.io/en/v1.14.4_beta/streamsx.topology.html#module-streamsx.topology>`_

Additional streamsx packages providing adapters and/or analytics
are `available at pypi.org <https://pypi.org/search/?q=streamsx>`_

Python callables as SPL operators
=================================
A Python function or class can be simply turned into an SPL primitive operator
to allow tuple processing using Python in an SPL application.

SPL (Streams Processing Language) is a domain specific language for streaming
analytics supported by IBM Streams.

See `streamsx.spl <https://streamsxtopology.readthedocs.io/en/v1.14.4_beta/streamsx.spl.spl.html#module-streamsx.spl.spl>`_

Streams Python REST API
=======================

Module that allows interaction with an running Streams instance or service
through HTTPS REST APIs.

See `streamsx.rest <https://streamsxtopology.readthedocs.io/en/v1.14.4_beta/streamsx.rest.html#module-streamsx.rest>`_
