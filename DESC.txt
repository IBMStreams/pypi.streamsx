Python Topology API for Streams
===============================
Module that allows the definition and execution of streaming
applications implemented in Python. Applications use Python code to process
tuples and tuples are Python objects.

See `streamsx.topology <https://streamsxtopology.readthedocs.io/en/stable/streamsx.topology.html#module-streamsx.topology>`_

Python callables as SPL operators
=================================
A Python function or class can be simply turned into an SPL primitive operator
to allow tuple processing using Python in an SPL application.

SPL (Streams Processing Language) is a domain specific language for streaming
analytics supported by IBM Streams.

See `streamsx.spl <https://streamsxtopology.readthedocs.io/en/stable/streamsx.spl.spl.html#module-streamsx.spl.spl>`_

Streams Python REST API
=======================

Module that allows interaction with an running Streams instance or service
through HTTPS REST APIs.

See `streamsx.rest <https://streamsxtopology.readthedocs.io/en/stable/streamsx.rest.html#module-streamsx.rest>`_
