Python APIs for use with Streaming Analytics service on
IBM Bluemix cloud platform and on-premises IBM Streams.

Python Application API for Streams
==================================
Module that allows the definition and execution of streaming
applications implemented in Python. Applications use Python code to process
tuples and tuples are Python objects.

See `streamsx.topology <http://ibmstreams.github.io/streamsx.topology/doc/pythondoc/index.html>`_

Python functions as SPL operators
=================================
A Python function or class can be simply turned into an SPL primitive operator
to allow tuple processing using Python in an SPL application.

SPL (Streams Processing Language) is a domain specific language for streaming
analytics supported by IBM Streams.

See `streamsx.spl <http://ibmstreams.github.io/streamsx.topology/doc/pythondoc/index.html>`_

Streams Python REST API
=======================

Module that allows interaction with an running Streams instance or service
through HTTPS REST APIs.

See `streamsx.rest<http://ibmstreams.github.io/streamsx.topology/doc/pythondoc/index.html>`_
